# js-assignment-copy-page

In this assignment, students are tasked with copying the [Mac tech specs](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/specs/) webpage in HTML and CSS. This will give them practice with layouts in CSS and allow them to play around with the tags available in HTML5. Students should try to make their copy of the page as accurate as possible without literally copying any code from the site.
